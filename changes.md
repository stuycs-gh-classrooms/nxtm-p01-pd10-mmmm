Changes we've made:
- We do in fact need a 1D array for our bullets. We are still figuring out how to implement, may need to use code from ListArray since we need to append new bullets everytime space is pressed.
- We need two seperate classes for invaders, the single invader and the "swarm" of invaders. (similar to land vs forest classes) The swarm will be the one shooting bullets
- collision checks for all classes in the bullet class. 
- using states saved as integers 1 and 0. 1 is alive and 0 is dead. since everything needs to die (even bullets on collision)!
