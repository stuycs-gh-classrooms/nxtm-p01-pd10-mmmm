Cool things:

    I love the idea of making different difficulty levels for the game!
    Nice, practical keyboard controls. I think it's important to consider hand dexterity especially for games. Using the space bar to shoot and left/right for movement is easy to do.

Clarifying Qs:

    Does the question mark in 1D Arrays indicate that you're not using them?
    Perhaps I missed this, but do you have a reset button? Does it show up in the menu when you press the ESC button?
    How will you be organizing your invaders? Check out my suggestion below twins

Suggestions:

    If you create more invaders, I imagine it would make sense to denote about 2-3 different kinds of invaders, such as one that impacts movement, another that impacts speed, etc. and creating separate classes for them.
    Adding a health bar would be interesting, maybe through a method that evaluates the number of shots taken.
